The Composite Pattern allows you to
compose objects into tree structures to
represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite
lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.

In this example, we demonstrate the usage of
Composite pattern by relating sub-items to a parent
item using a Composite class. Here, the parent item will
be Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker) while the sub items
will be Luke Skywalker and Leia Skywalker.
